# Linux_machine
During the course of my computer systems class we took older school computers and flashed them with the Linux distro of our choice
My choice was Ubuntu,https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop,
Using BalenaEtcher,https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher, I flahsed Linux onto a flashdrive 
Entering into the systems bios I altered the boot drive to be the flashdrive initally. 
Following the steps I installed Linux onto the Hard drive and changed the boot drive back the internal hard drive
